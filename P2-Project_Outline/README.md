## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application will be able to 'simply' and 'easily' let classmates share their homework assignments. Background to this is my own experience in the Calculus classes being difficult to understand how to solve complex problems. It would be cool if work and ideas could be saved and looked back upon amongst a group of people instead of having to remember complex solutions then later trying to put it all together say right before a test. It would also be interesting to implement a system where you coudl pay someone for homework help. So I thought that if I could do this before the Summer of 2018 I would be set for harder projects that I want to pursue. To be clear this is a test project to push myself to learn broader concepts and technologies.
