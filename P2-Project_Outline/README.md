## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This application will be able to let WCA users put a goal on another WCA user in the form of currency. Background to this is that there are Rubik's speedcube competitions that I organize and I've noticed that most competitors don't win any prize money. So I thought if I could get the other competitors to actual try to win something without being the best. They can break their own scores without beating everyone else.
